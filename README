TrinityCore is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++. It is completely 
open source, and is community supported. It is derived
from MaNGOS, the Massive Network Game Object Server, and is based on the
code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve
and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the ingame mechanics
and functionality. If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit 
our site linked below or make pull requests to our github repo at 
https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore

Documentation including installation instructions can be found inside
the doc directory.

sql/base directories.
You need to run sql/create/create_mysql.sql 1st and then
sql/base/auth_database.sql, sql/base/characters_database.sql and then 
sql/base/world_database.sql

All Updates to the world db or char or auth db shall be placed in sql/update/world
or sql/update/auth or sql/update/characters

under Windows or cat *.sql > world_updates under Linux.
